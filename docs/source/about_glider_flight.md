# Glider flight models (a primer)

This will eventually be some overview of how glider flight model works (equations), how it's applied (code to compute flight and minimisations or searches to determine unknown parameters like lift and drag), and considerations that aren't taken into account by the basic equations (compressibility of the vehicle overall, of oil in the bladder, or issues/errors in measured seawater density).
